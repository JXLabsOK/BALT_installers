## 🛠 How it works

- The launcher embeds the BΔLT dApp (`dist/`) inside a lightweight executable.  
- When you run it, a local server starts at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` and opens automatically in your browser.  
- This allows you to interact with BΔLT **without relying on any centralized website**.  
- For Android, the app is packaged with Capacitor and runs offline in a WebView.

## 🔐 Transparency

- **Smart Contracts** → open source and audited by Coinspect: [balt-smartcontracts](https://github.com/JXLabsOK/BALT_SmartContracts)  
- **dApp frontend** → will be progressively open-sourced once BΔLT is consolidated as a recognized protocol.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

BΔLT is a fully decentralized system. By interacting with it, you agree to the terms and disclaimers detailed in the [Whitepaper](https://jxlabs.xyz/BALT_Whitepaper.pdf).
